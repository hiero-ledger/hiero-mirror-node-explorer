# Mirror Node Explorer Configuration

Mirror Node Explorer can be configured using the following files:
- [core-config.json](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node-explorer/blob/main/public/core-config.json) enables to set global configuration parameters. These encompass in particular all visual and textual elements which constitute the branding of the explorer.
- [networks-config.json](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node-explorer/blob/main/public/networks-config.json) provides the definition of the networks (e.g. mainnet, testnet…) that can be explored as well as network-specific configuration parameters.
- [style-config.css](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-mirror-node-explorer/blob/main/public/style-config.css) specifies the CSS colors used depending upon the mode (light/dark) and network chosen.

#### About optional parameters
Unless specified, parameter values can be absent or `null`. In that case, Explorer applies a default behavior specified in the sections below.

#### About URL parameters
Relative URL can be specified: they are resolved against root directory of the application distrib (the one that contains `index.html`)

endpoints allowing to retrieve the sources files of a verified contract.

### `serverURL`

## style-config.css

This file contains a set of CSS variables defining colors. There are 2 main categories of variables:

### variables defining the colors depending on the MODE (light / dark) selected
These are named as follows:
* `--light-<variable-name>` : defines the value which will be assigned to the variable `--<variable-name>` (used in the code) when light mode is selected
* `--dark-<variable-name>` : defines the value which will be assigned to the variable `--<variable-name>` (used in the code) when dark mode is selected

### variables defining the colors depending on the NETWORK selected
These are named as follows:
* `--<color-theme>-<property-name>` : defines the value of the property `ColorMap.<propertyName>` in an entry of the NetworkColorMaps.

`<color-theme>` is currently one of: { _purple_, _orange_, _yellow_ } 

Given the set of networks defined in the networks-config.json file, each network is assigned a color theme as follows:
* 1st network: purple
* 2nd network: orange
* 3rd network: yellow
* 4th network: purple
* 5th network: orange
* 6th network: yellow
* and so on…
